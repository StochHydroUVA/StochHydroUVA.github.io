  <strong><b>Course Description: </b></strong>
          <p>The goal of this course is to illustrate the importance of uncertainty analysis in hydrology. 
            Whether data-driven or mechanistically-driven, all hydrologic models have errors, 
            and the data used to build such models represent just a sample of a stochastic process. 
            Quantifying the uncertainty in hydrologic model predictions due to limited data availability and model error 
            is important for informing the design and management of civil infrastructure systems. 

            In this course, students will learn stochastic methods used in hydrology for this purpose. 
            Specific statistical concepts covered include applications of extreme value theory 
            to estimate flood and drought statistics, parameter estimation for hydrological model calibration, 
            and trend analysis of historical time series. Students should leave the course with an understanding 
            of how to apply these methods in practice to design civil infrastructure systems that are robust to 
            hydrologic uncertainty.</p>

        <strong><b>Homeworks: </b></strong>
        <p>Eight homework assignments will be assigned throughout the course of the semester.
          They will typically be assigned on Thursdays in class and due the following week on Friday at 11:59 PM, or Sunday at 11:59 PM for VEO students.
          These assignments consist of environmental optimization problems to be solved using the methods taught in class. 
          Some problems will require analytical solutions, while others can be solved numerically using Python optimization packages.
        <br /> <br />Students may work together and seek help at office hours, but are encouraged to first try all problems on their own, 
          as the analytical problems are excellent practice for exams.</p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="exams" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Exams: </b></strong>
        <p>Exams are based entirely on classroom notes and discussions, readings, and homeworks. Each exam will be closed book and require analytical problem solving.
          The exam will take place during class time, except for VEO students, who will take it remotely on Canvas through the Quizzes page and upload their answers within 75 minutes.
          Example questions for both exams will be provided a week beforehand.</p>
      </p>

      <p id="projects" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>CE 4110 Group Project: </b></strong>
        <p>The class will have a final group project (~3 students/group) utilizing the Advanced Topics of this course on a real-world environmental problem. 
          The instructors will provide a few models that students can choose to use for their project.
          The students will define a problem that this model and the advanced tools in class can be used to address.
          These projects will provide students with an opportunity to not only apply the tools in class to a real-world problem, 
          but also to proficiently communicate results in a recorded presentation and a technical document or client report.
        Students will also have an opportunity to provide feedback to other groups on their projects and recorded presentations, 
          which they will deliver in writing, as well as in person on the last day of class.</p>

        <strong><b>CE 6250 Individual Project: </b></strong>
        <p>The class will have a final individual project utilizing the Advanced Topics of this course on a real-world environmental problem. 
          The students will define their own environmental problem and write a proposal on how they will use the advanced tools in class to address it.
          These projects will provide students with an opportunity to not only apply the tools in class to a real-world problem, 
          but also to proficiently communicate results in a recorded presentation and a technical document or client report.
        Students will also have an opportunity to provide feedback to other groups on their projects and recorded presentations,

  <strong><b>Submission and Late Submission Policy: </b></strong> 
        <p>On the day a homework or project is due, you must submit an electronic copy <strong>in pdf (NOT doc or docx, etc.)</strong> along with source code on the Canvas site and pledge your submission.
        No late assignments will be accepted in this class, unless the student has procured special accommodations for warranted circumstances. <br />
        <br />In many cases you will do better to submit an incomplete assignment rather than a late one.</p>
      </p>
      <p id="AI" style="padding-top": 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence:</b></strong>
        <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, video, and other content—have become widely available. 
          Well-known examples include ChatGPT for text and DALL•E for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our semester together. 
          You may NOT use generative AI tools in this course for homeworks. You may use them on projects when I explicitly permit you to do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools. 
          If you DO use generative AI tools on  projects in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. 
          Cite the tool you used, following the pattern for computer software given in the specified style guide. Additionally, please include a brief description of how you used the tool. <br />
          <br />If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. 
          Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in plagiarism or copyright violations. 
          Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; 
          therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility—not the tool's—to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. 
          If you use generative AI tools to complete assignments in this course, in ways that I have not explicitly authorized, I will apply the UVA Honor Code as appropriate to your specific case. 
          In addition, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.</p>
    </p>
      <p id="recording" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Recording of Lectures: </b></strong>
        <p>Every lecture will be recorded in order to accommodate students VEO students, as well as students who are sick or cannot attend for some other reason. 
          Because lectures include fellow students, you and they may be personally identifiable on the recordings. 
          These recordings may only be used for the purpose of individual or group study with other students enrolled in this class during this semester. <br />
        <br />You may not distribute them in whole or in part through any other platform or to any persons outside of this class, nor may you make your own recordings 
        of this class unless written permission has been obtained from the Instructor and all participants in the class have been informed that recording will occur. 
        If you want additional details on this, please see Provost Policy 008 and follow-up guidelines.
        <strong>If you notice that I have failed to activate the recording feature, please remind me!</strong></p>

      <p id="illness" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Illness: </b></strong> 
        <p>I try to create a safe environment, not only for you (our students), but also for our faculty and our staff. To that end, please stay home or in 
          your dorm room if you are ill with or are symptomatic for any communicable disease. I would rather you stay home and work something out with 
          me for making up work or taking an exam than for an illness to spread through the class. If you believe you are sick, please contact Student 
          Health for appropriate treatment or testing. </p>
      </p>
     
      </p>
      <p id="religious" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Religious Accommodations: </b></strong> 
        <p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence 
          when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>
        <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by private message on Piazza
          as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact 
          the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p>
      </p>

      <p id="accessibility" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Accessibility Statement: </b></strong> 
        <p> It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. 
          If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. 
          Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, 
          including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at 
          <a href="mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu">cmacmasters@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: <a href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC">https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC</a>. 
          If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send us your accommodation letter and meet with us so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p>
      </p>
      
       <p id="integrity" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Academic Integrity Statement: </b></strong> 
        <p>"The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. 
        I firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University's Honor principle that students will not lie, 
        cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. I recognize that even one honor infraction can 
        destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles 
        of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 
        Students are expected to be familiar with the <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud">university honor code</a>, 
        including the section on academic fraud." <br />
        <br />In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any overlap in source code of 
        sufficient similarity will be potentially flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk
        about the assignment but not share code as this would potentially incur on an honor code violation.
        Regardless of circumstances, I will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship
        of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded potentially
        as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating
  what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.</p>

        <p>You may schedule time with the CAPS counselors through <a href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/getting-started-caps">Student Health</a>. 
           When scheduling, be sure to specify that you are an Engineering student. You are also urged to use <a href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/timelycare">TimelyCare</a>

   <strong><b>Community and Identity: </b></strong>
        <p>The Center for Diversity in Engineering (CDE) is a student space dedicated to advocating for underrepresented groups in STEM. It exists to 
        connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world. The CDE includes
        an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural
        fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.</p>

  <strong><b>Harrassment, Discrimination and Interpersonal Violence:</b></strong>
<p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
  If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website 
  that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="https://uvapolice.virginia.edu/sexual-and-dating-violence-resources">www.virginia.edu/sexual-and-dating-violence-resources</a>.</p>
  <p>The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  
    UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, 
    marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, 
    religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. </p>
<p>If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It 
  (<a href="https://justreportit.virginia.edu/">https://justreportit.virginia.edu/</a>) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p>
  <p>If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to 
    Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”) and Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).</p>
<p>As your professor, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a
  responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report 
  to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and 
  support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. </p>
